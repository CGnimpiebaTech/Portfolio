# Presentation 

Hi there!

If you’re here, it probably means you’re curious about the projects I worked on during my university years.
I’m Cristelle, currently completing my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Applied Sciences Fulda.
This is my first portfolio, and I hope the projects I’ve worked on over the past three years give you a good idea of what I’m capable of.

Thanks for stopping by – I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
